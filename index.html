                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>I am currently a developer student at DeltaV Code School in Cedar Rapids, IA! I am enjoying greatly and cannot wait for the opportunity to utilize what I am learning.
                    <br> <br>
                    I was born in Illinois while my father was in the navy. I spend the next few decades moving from state to state, most in the Midwest. Iowa seemed to be the most common destination, so I decided to just settle here! I enjoy exploring and hiking in the woods with my two dogs, taking long drives in my Kia, and reading a good sci-fi/fantasy book.

                        <br><br>
                        Since then I have taken some random individual courses there, mostly mathemeatics related.

                    <p>My current goal is finishing the DeltaV program with the best grades I can get! After that I hope to find a job as a Software Developer, so I can take advantage of all the programming I have learned. I would also like to work on different apps to help people with ADHD.
